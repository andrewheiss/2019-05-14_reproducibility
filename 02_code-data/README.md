# Code and data combined

This is a step above the `01_code-only` example. For one, there's a README! Also, the folder is set up as an RStudio project and the data is included. To make things more manageable, some of the code has been divided into smaller files/modules.


## Instructions

Run these files in this order:

- `process-data.R`
- `figure-1.R`
- `models_figure-2.R`

You should have two figures and a table in `output/` if it worked.
